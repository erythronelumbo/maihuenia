@brief Other related work

The decisions behind the design of this library and its functionalities were
also based in other, already existing template metaprogramming libraries:

- Boost's [MPL](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/mpl/),
  [Mp11](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/mp11/) and
  [Hana](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/hana/).
- [MPL11](https://github.com/ldionne/mpl11), where the typeclass approach is
  based on.
- [Mulinum](https://github.com/erythronelumbo/mulinum), the library Maihuenia
  is made to supersede.

Also, the following articles were also helpful:

- Matt Bierner's [_Stupid Template Tricks_](https://blog.mattbierner.com/series/stupid_template_tricks/)
  series of articles.
- [Simple C++11 metaprogramming](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/mp11/doc/html/simple_cxx11_metaprogramming.html)
  and [its sequel](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/mp11/doc/html/simple_cxx11_metaprogramming_2.html)
  by Peter Dimov (author of the aforementioned Boost.Mp11).
