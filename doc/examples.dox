/**
@page pg_ex_custom_typeclass Custom typeclass
@brief Defining a custom typeclass

In this example, we will define a custom typeclass, as well as specialize it for
a data type.

@include example/custom_typeclass.cpp

/**
@page pg_ex_fibonacci Fibonacci numbers
@brief Calculating Fibonacci numbers at compile time

Here we will calculate Fibonacci numbers recursively, with three different
methods: with a na√Øve implementation, using `until` and using `lambda`. This
program will also print a table with the resulting Fibonacci numbers, calculated
with these methods.

@include example/fibonacci.cpp
*/

/**
@page pg_ex_ordering_strings Ordering strings
@brief Ordering strings in alphabetical order

This example shows how we can sort strings (in this case, names of insects) in
alphabetical order. The resulting program will print these names in their
original order, in alphabetical order and in reverse alphabetical order.

@include example/ordering_strings.cpp
